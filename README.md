# Gender_Age_Detection

## Dataset Information
UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc.

The objective of the project is to detect gender and age using facial images. There are 2 output types namely, gender(0 : Male or 1 : Female) and age. Convolutional Neural Network is used in this model for Gender Classification and Age prediction using Regression.
