# Gender_Age_Detection

## Dataset Information
UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc.

## Model Architecture
The objective of the project is to detect gender and age using facial images. There are 2 output types namely, gender(0 : Male or 1 : Female) and age. Convolutional Neural Network is used in this model for Gender Classification and Age prediction using Regression. 

## Technologies Used
This project was implemented using the following technologies:

TensorFlow and Keras: for building and training the deep learning model.

PIL, OpenCV: for image processing.

os: for handling the image files.

sns: for exploration of the image dataset

Matplotlib: for visualizing the training and validation results.
